;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides integration with jedi virtualenv and buildout.
;; When working within a virtualenv, configure python sys.path passed
;; to `jedi:server-args' such jedi commands `jedi:complete',
;; `jedi:goto-definition' and `jedi:doc' show the correct sources.
;;
;; Installation:
;; If not using ELPA (i.e list-packages), then add the following to
;; you init.el/.emacs:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path 'path-to-this-file)
;; (require 'pungi)
;;
;; Usage:
;;   When you'd like project specific variables to be taken into account,
;;   e.g python-mode specific changes, you can place a file at the root
;;   of the project directory called .dir-locals.el, in which
;;   you can set variables on a per-mode, or global basis.
;;   See http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html
;;   for documentation.
;;   Set the `pungi-setup-jedi' to a non-nil value in order for `jedi:setup' to
;;   take those settings into account.
;;
;;   If jedi has been required, then jedi:setup will be triggered when
;;   python-mode-hook is fired.
;;
;; Testing:
;;   When visiting a python buffer, move the cursor over a symbol
;;   and check that invoking M-x `jedi:goto-definition' opens a
;;   new buffer showing the source of that python symbol.
